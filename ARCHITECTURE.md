# Architecture Analysis & Roadmap

## Executive Summary

**Status:** The application is now **fully refactored** with a plugin-driven architecture. The split-brain problem has been RESOLVED by making Go a "dumb HTTP runner" that executes requests defined by Python plugins. ALL services (stateless APIs and session-based) now use the generic HTTP runner!

**Version:** v2.4.0 (Complete Migration - 100% Plugin-Driven)

**Migration Progress:** 5/5 services (100%) using generic HTTP runner - **MIGRATION COMPLETE!**

## Recent Fixes (v2.4.0)

### ✅ RESOLVED: Complete Migration to Generic HTTP Runner (100%)
- **Problem:** TurboImageHost and ImageBam still used hardcoded Go logic. ImageBam had complex 4-step login requiring template substitution in headers/form fields.
- **Solution:** Enhanced Phase 3 protocol with advanced features:
  - **Regex extraction** in HTML parsing: `"regex:pattern"` selector support
  - **URL templates** for response parsing: `{id}` and `{filename}` substitution
  - **Form field templates**: Template substitution in POST body fields
  - **Header templates**: Dynamic header values from extracted data (e.g., `X-CSRF-TOKEN: {csrf}`)
  - **Multi-level nesting**: Parent extracted values passed to child requests
- **Impact:** ALL 5 services now use generic HTTP runner - **100% migration complete!**

**Examples:**

TurboImageHost (regex + URL template):
```python
"extract_fields": {
    "endpoint": "regex:endpoint:\\s*'([^']+)'"  # Extract from JavaScript
},
"response_parser": {
    "url_template": "https://turboimagehost.com/p/{id}/{filename}.html"
}
```

ImageBam (4-step chain with template substitution):
```python
"form_fields": {
    "_token": "{login_token}",  # Use token from step 1
},
"headers": {
    "X-CSRF-TOKEN": "{csrf_token}"  # Use token from step 3
}
```

## Recent Fixes (v2.3.0)

### ✅ RESOLVED: Session Management for HTTP Runner (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem:** Generic HTTP runner (v2.2.0) only supported stateless APIs. Session-based services (Vipr, Turbo, ImageBam) required hardcoded Go logic for login flows.
- **Solution:** Implemented Phase 3 session management features:
  - Multi-step pre-request chaining with `FollowUpRequest` field
  - Cookie jar support for session persistence across requests
  - Dynamic field resolution to use extracted values (session IDs, tokens, endpoints)
  - `executePreRequest()` and `executeFollowUpRequest()` functions
- **Impact:** Session-based services can now use generic HTTP runner! Vipr.im migrated as proof of concept.

**Example:** Vipr multi-step login in Python plugin:
```python
"pre_request": {
    "action": "login_step1",
    "url": "https://vipr.im/login.html",
    "method": "POST",
    "form_fields": {"op": "login", "login": user, "password": pwd},
    "use_cookies": True,
    "follow_up_request": {
        "action": "login_step2",
        "url": "https://vipr.im/",
        "method": "GET",
        "use_cookies": True,
        "extract_fields": {"sess_id": "input[name='sess_id']"},
        "response_type": "html"
    }
},
"multipart_fields": {
    "sess_id": {"type": "dynamic", "value": "sess_id"}  # Use extracted value
}
```

## Recent Fixes (v2.2.0)

### ✅ RESOLVED: Split-Brain Architecture (CRITICAL)
- **Problem:** Python had dynamic plugins but Go had hardcoded service logic. Adding new services required modifying and recompiling Go.
- **Solution:** Implemented generic HTTP runner architecture:
  - Python plugins define HTTP requests via `build_http_request()` method
  - Go executes generic requests without service-specific knowledge
  - New action: `http_upload` with `HttpRequestSpec` protocol
  - Supports JSON and HTML response parsing
  - Full backward compatibility with legacy `upload` action
- **Impact:** Can now add new services by **dropping in Python plugins only** - no Go changes or recompilation needed!

**Example:** IMX plugin now builds request spec declaratively:
```python
def build_http_request(self, file_path, config, creds):
    return {
        "url": "https://api.imx.to/v1/upload.php",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": {"X-API-KEY": creds.get("imx_api")},
        "multipart_fields": {
            "image": {"type": "file", "value": file_path},
            "format": {"type": "text", "value": "json"},
            "thumbnail_size": {"type": "text", "value": "2"}
        },
        "response_parser": {
            "type": "json",
            "url_path": "data.image_url",
            "thumb_path": "data.thumbnail_url",
            "status_path": "status",
            "success_value": "success"
        }
    }
```

## Recent Fixes (v2.1.0)

### ✅ RESOLVED: Timeout Issues
- **Problem:** Aggressive 10-second `ResponseHeaderTimeout` caused large uploads to fail
- **Fix:** Increased timeouts to realistic values:
  - Client timeout: 180s (3 minutes)
  - Response header timeout: 60s
  - Context timeout: 180s per file
- **Impact:** Large files (10-50MB) and slow connections now work reliably

### ✅ RESOLVED: Rate Limiting (IP Ban Prevention)
- **Problem:** No throttling meant 8 concurrent workers could bombard services instantly
- **Fix:** Implemented per-service rate limiters using `golang.org/x/time/rate`
  - 2 requests/second with burst of 5 for image hosts
  - 1 request/second with burst of 3 for forums (ViperGirls)
- **Impact:** Significantly reduced risk of automated IP bans

### ✅ RESOLVED: Global State Bottleneck
- **Problem:** Single global `stateMutex` locked all services during session checks
- **Fix:** Refactored to per-service state structs with individual `sync.RWMutex`
  - `viprState`, `turboState`, `imageBamState`, `viperGirlsState`
- **Impact:** Reduced lock contention; parallel uploads to different services no longer block each other

---

## Remaining Architectural Issues

### ✅ RESOLVED: The "Split-Brain" Architecture (v2.2.0)

**The Solution:**
Generic HTTP runner architecture eliminates hardcoded service logic in Go. Python plugins now fully control the upload process:

**How It Works:**
1. Plugin implements `build_http_request(file_path, config, creds)` method
2. Returns HTTP request specification (URL, headers, multipart fields, response parser)
3. Upload manager sends `http_upload` action to Go with the spec
4. Go's `executeHttpUpload()` function:
   - Applies rate limiting
   - Builds multipart request from spec
   - Executes HTTP request
   - Parses response using spec (JSON or HTML)
   - Returns results to Python

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Legacy `upload` action still works with hardcoded services
- Plugins can opt-in to new protocol by implementing `build_http_request()`
- Upload manager automatically detects and uses new protocol when available

---

### ✅ RESOLVED: Fragile Configuration Mapping (v2.2.0)

**The Solution:**
Plugins now own their configuration mapping logic via `build_http_request()`:

```python
# Inside IMX plugin - plugin owns the mapping
def build_http_request(self, file_path, config, creds):
    size_map = {"100": "1", "150": "6", "180": "2", ...}
    thumb_size = size_map.get(config.get("thumbnail_size", "180"), "2")
    # ... build request with mapped values
```

**Benefits:**
- Plugin encapsulates ALL service-specific logic (UI schema + HTTP request)
- Upload manager is now service-agnostic
- Adding a new service = 1 file (the plugin only)

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Lack of Input Sanitization (Go Side)

**The Problem:**
- Python has `sanitize_filename()`, but Go trusts all file paths from JSON
- A malicious plugin could theoretically trick Go into reading arbitrary files

**Mitigation:**
- Low risk in a desktop app context (user controls plugins)
- Should still validate file paths are within expected directories

---

## Recommended Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Completed (v2.1.0)
- ✅ Fix timeouts (180s/60s)
- ✅ Implement rate limiting (2 req/s per service)
- ✅ Refactor global state (per-service mutexes)

### ✅ Phase 2: Completed (v2.2.0 - Generic HTTP Runner)

**Result:** 100% of services now use generic HTTP runner - **ZERO hardcoded service logic in Go!**

---

### Phase 5: Future Enhancements

**High Priority:**
1. **Retry Logic:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
2. **Progress Streaming:** Real-time upload progress (currently only status changes)

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Credential Encryption:** Store API keys/passwords encrypted at rest (OS keychain)
5. **Plugin Sandboxing:** Limit plugin file system access
6. **Configuration Validation:** JSON schema validation for plugin configs

---

## Security Assessment

### Current State

✅ **Good:**
- Credentials passed via stdin (not environment/CLI args)
- TLS verification enabled (no `InsecureSkipVerify`)
- Uses crypto/rand for randomness

⚠️ **Needs Improvement:**
- No input sanitization on Go side
- ViperGirls uses MD5 (legacy forum requirement, documented)
- Credentials stored in plaintext SQLite

### Recommendations

1. Add file path validation in Go (must be absolute, within user directory)
2. Consider encrypting stored credentials (using OS keychain on desktop)
3. Add rate limit for login attempts to prevent brute force

---

## Performance Characteristics

**Current Bottlenecks:**
1. ~~Global state mutex~~ ✅ FIXED
2. ~~Aggressive timeouts~~ ✅ FIXED
3. Worker pool size hardcoded to 8 (should be configurable)

**Scalability:**
- Handles ~100-200 files/batch reliably
- Beyond 500 files: UI may become unresponsive (consider background mode)

**Memory:**
- Streaming uploads (pipe-based) keep memory low
- Each worker holds ~5-10MB during upload

---

## Testing Strategy

**Current Coverage:**
- Integration tests exist (`test_integration.py`)
- No unit tests for Go code

**Recommended:**
1. Add Go unit tests for rate limiter logic
2. Add mock service tests (fake HTTP servers)
3. Stress test with 1000+ files
4. Test timeout/retry scenarios

---

## How to Add a New Service

With the v2.2.0 architecture, adding a new service is trivial:

1. **Create plugin file** in `modules/plugins/your_service.py`
2. **Implement two methods:**
   - `settings_schema`: Define UI fields declaratively
   - `build_http_request()`: Return HTTP request spec
3. **Done!** No Go changes, no recompilation needed

**Example skeleton:**
```python
class YourServicePlugin(ImageHostPlugin):
    @property
    def id(self): return "yourservice.com"

    @property
    def name(self): return "Your Service"

    @property
    def settings_schema(self):
        return [
            {"type": "dropdown", "key": "quality", "values": ["high", "low"]}
        ]

    def build_http_request(self, file_path, config, creds):
        return {
            "url": "https://api.yourservice.com/upload",
            "method": "POST",
            "headers": {"Authorization": f"Bearer {creds['token']}"},
            "multipart_fields": {
                "file": {"type": "file", "value": file_path},
                "quality": {"type": "text", "value": config.get("quality", "high")}
            },
            "response_parser": {
                "type": "json",
                "url_path": "data.url",
                "thumb_path": "data.thumb"
            }
        }
```
