## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-11

### 🔧 Fixed

#### **Critical Bug Fixes**
- **PyInstaller Plugin Discovery and Bundling**
  - Fixed image host dropdown not working in release builds
  - **Primary Issue**: Plugin modules were not being bundled by PyInstaller at all
  - **Secondary Issue**: Plugin discovery code used filesystem paths instead of module introspection
  - **Build Script Fixes**:
    - Added `--collect-submodules modules.plugins` to bundle all plugin modules
    - Added explicit `--hidden-import` for each plugin (imx, pixhost, vipr, turbo, imagebam, imgur)
    - Updated `build_uploader.bat` for Windows local builds
    - Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` for CI/CD builds (all platforms)
  - **Code Fixes**:
    - Replaced filesystem-based discovery (`Path.glob`) with `pkgutil.iter_modules`
    - Plugin discovery now works correctly in both development and PyInstaller builds
  - **Impact**: Users can now select different image hosts from the dropdown in release builds
