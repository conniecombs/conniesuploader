## ✅ Verification

After building, verify everything works:

### 1. Check File Size
```batch
dir dist\ConniesUploader.exe
```
**Expected:** 40-50 MB (if only 26 MB, sidecar is missing!)

### 2. Test Sidecar Inclusion
```batch
python test_sidecar.py
```
**Expected output:**
```
✓ FOUND at: C:\...\Temp\_MEI123\uploader.exe
✓ SUCCESS: uploader.exe found!
```

### 3. Test Upload
1. Run ConniesUploader.exe
2. Add test image
3. Select service (IMX, Pixhost, etc.)
4. Click "Start Upload"
5. Verify upload completes successfully

### 4. Check Logs
- **View > View Log** to see structured logging
- Look for JSON-formatted entries with timestamps
- Verify no errors during startup

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues

1. **First Build Slow** - Initial build downloads Python/Go (10-15 minutes)
   - **Workaround:** Subsequent builds are much faster

2. **Antivirus False Positives** - Some AVs flag PyInstaller executables
   - **Workaround:** Add exception for `dist\ConniesUploader.exe`

3. **Windows Defender SmartScreen** - May show warning on first run
   - **Workaround:** Click "More info" → "Run anyway"

### Limitations

- **Windows Only** - macOS/Linux support planned for future release
- **No Dark Mode** - UI currently light mode only
- **Limited Services** - 6 image hosts supported (IMX, Pixhost, Vipr, Turbo, ImageBam, Imgur)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem:** EXE is only 26 MB  
**Solution:** See [BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Problem:** "uploader.exe not found"  
**Solution:** 
```batch
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o uploader.exe uploader.go
build_uploader.bat
```

**Problem:** Uploads don't work  
**Solution:** Run `python test_sidecar.py` to diagnose

### Runtime Issues

**Problem:** Crash on startup  
**Solution:** Check log window for errors, verify credentials

**Problem:** Uploads fail immediately  
**Solution:** Check internet connection, verify service credentials

**Problem:** Memory usage grows  
**Solution:** Restart application (should be stable in v1.0.0)
