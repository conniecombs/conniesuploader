3. Download and install Go 1.24+ if needed
4. Build the Go backend (uploader.exe)
5. Create a Python virtual environment
6. Install all dependencies
7. Build the final executable using PyInstaller

The final executable will be in the `dist` folder.

**Note**: 32-bit Windows is no longer supported due to dependency requirements.

## Usage

### First-Time Setup

1. **Set Credentials** - Go to `Tools > Set Credentials` and enter your API keys and login credentials for the services you plan to use:
   - **imx.to**: Requires API key (get from imx.to account settings)
   - **pixhost.to**: Username and password (supports both v1 and v2 APIs)
   - **Other services**: Username and password

2. **Select Image Host** - Choose your preferred image hosting service from the dropdown

3. **Configure Settings** - Adjust thread limits, thumbnail sizes, and content ratings as needed

### Basic Upload Workflow

1. **Add Images:**
   - Click `File > Add Files` or `File > Add Folder`
   - Drag and drop files/folders directly into the window
   - Each folder becomes a separate upload batch/group

2. **Configure Batch:**
   - Edit the group title (double-click)
   - Select output template (BBCode, HTML, etc.)
   - Optionally select a ViperGirls thread for auto-posting

3. **Start Upload:**
   - Click `Start Upload`
   - Monitor progress in real-time with per-file status updates
   - Failed uploads automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
   - Use `Retry Failed` button to manually retry any failed uploads

4. **Get Results:**
   - Output files are saved to the `Output` folder
   - Backup copies saved to `~/.conniesuploader/history/`
   - If auto-copy is enabled, formatted text is copied to clipboard
   - Click `Open Output Folder` to view generated files

### Gallery Management

Access `Tools > Manage Galleries` to:
- View existing galleries
- Create new galleries
- Set gallery for current uploads

### Template Editor

Access `Tools > Template Editor` to:
- Create custom output templates
- Use placeholders: `{gallery_link}`, `{gallery_name}`, `{viewer}`, `{thumb}`, `{direct}`
- Preview templates with live data

### ViperGirls Integration

1. Set ViperGirls credentials in `Tools > Set Credentials > ViperGirls`
2. Access `Tools > Viper Tools` to:
   - Add thread URLs with custom names
   - Test credentials
3. When uploading, select a thread from the dropdown to auto-post results

**Security Note**: ViperGirls uses MD5 password hashing (legacy vBulletin API requirement). This is a documented limitation. Users should use unique passwords.

### Context Menu Integration (Windows)

Install `Tools > Install Context Menu` to add "Upload with Connie's Uploader" to Windows Explorer right-click menu.

## Configuration

### Settings File
Application settings are stored in `user_settings.json` in the application directory.

### Credentials
Credentials are securely stored in the system keyring:
- **Windows**: Credential Manager
- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Linux**: Secret Service API

### Output Files
- **Output folder**: `./Output/` - Session outputs
- **History folder**: `~/.conniesuploader/history/` - Permanent backup of all outputs

## Architecture

The application uses a modern hybrid architecture:

### Components
- **Python (CustomTkinter)**: Modern GUI interface with dark/light mode
- **Go**: High-performance upload backend with worker pools
- **JSON-RPC**: Communication between Python frontend and Go backend via stdin/stdout

### Design Benefits
- Fast, concurrent uploads (8 worker goroutines)
- Responsive UI during heavy operations
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Clean separation of concerns
- Exception-based error handling
- Structured logging (JSON format in Go, loguru in Python)

- Integration tests for full upload workflows

See **[REMAINING_ISSUES.md](REMAINING_ISSUES.md)** for complete list of 33 remaining issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"uploader.exe not found" error:**
- Ensure the Go backend was built successfully: `go build -o uploader.exe uploader.go`
- The `uploader.exe` (or `uploader` on Linux/macOS) must be in the same directory as `main.py`
- Check sidecar logs in the execution log window

**Upload fails immediately:**
- Check credentials in `Tools > Set Credentials`
- Verify API key is correct for imx.to
- Check execution log: `View > Execution Log`
- Review error messages (now uses structured exceptions)

**Python dependencies error:**
- Ensure all requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try recreating the virtual environment
- Verify Python 3.11+ is installed

**Build errors:**
- **Go version**: Ensure Go 1.24+ is installed (`go version`)
- **Python version**: Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed (`python --version`)
- Check internet connection for dependency downloads
- Run `go mod download` to verify Go dependencies

**Sidecar crashes/restarts:**
- Sidecar auto-restarts up to 5 times with exponential backoff
- Check execution log for crash details
- Verify `uploader.exe` is not corrupted (rebuild if needed)

### Logs
- **Runtime logs**: `View > Execution Log` in the application
- **Crash logs**: `crash_log.log` in the application directory
- **Go backend logs**: Structured JSON format in execution log
- **Python logs**: Via loguru with configurable levels

**Production Readiness: 85%**
- ✅ Zero known security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Auto-recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Cross-platform builds
- ✅ Clean architecture
- ⚠️ Test coverage needs improvement (12.5% → target 30%+)
- ⚠️ Rate limiting recommended before heavy use
- ⚠️ Graceful shutdown not yet implemented

**Recommendation**: Safe for controlled release with monitoring. Address test coverage and rate limiting before wider rollout.
