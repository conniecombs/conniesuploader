**Verify your download (recommended):**
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
certutil -hashfile ConniesUploader.exe SHA256

# Linux/macOS
sha256sum ConniesUploader  # or shasum -a 256 ConniesUploader

# Compare with the .sha256 file included in the release
```

### Option 2: Build from Source (All Platforms)

#### Quick Build (Recommended)

Use the cross-platform Makefile for the fastest and simplest build:

```bash
# Full build (clean + dependencies + compile)
make build

# Quick build (skip cleanup)
make quick

# Help
make help
```

The Makefile automatically detects your platform (Windows/Linux/macOS) and handles all dependencies.

**Other build options:**
- **Windows**: Run `build_uploader.bat` (auto-installs Python and Go if needed)
- **Linux/macOS**: Run `./build.sh` (with color output and progress indicators)

All build scripts will:
1. Check/install dependencies (Python 3.11+, Go 1.24+)
2. Build the Go backend (uploader.exe/uploader)
3. Create a Python virtual environment
4. Install all Python dependencies
5. Build the final executable using PyInstaller

The final executable will be in the `dist` folder.

**Note**: 32-bit Windows is no longer supported due to dependency requirements.

#### Manual Build

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.11+
- Go 1.24+ (**required** - goquery v1.11.0 dependency)

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/conniecombs/conniesuploader.git
cd conniesuploader
```

2. **Build Go backend:**
```bash
go mod download  # Download dependencies
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o uploader.exe uploader.go
```

3. **Set up Python environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Build System Features

The new cross-platform build system (v1.1.0) includes:

- ✅ **Makefile** - Universal build tool for all platforms
- ✅ **build.sh** - Linux/macOS script with color output and detailed progress
- ✅ **build_uploader.bat** - Windows script with auto-install (simplified from 311 to 227 lines)
- ✅ **Automatic dependency detection** - Checks for Python and Go before building
- ✅ **SHA256 verification** - Windows auto-install verifies downloads (security)
- ✅ **Clean builds** - Use `make clean` or `--clean` flag to remove old artifacts
- ✅ **Development mode** - Use `make dev` to set up environment without building

## Usage

### First-Time Setup

1. **Set Credentials** - Go to `Tools > Set Credentials` and enter your API keys and login credentials for the services you plan to use:
   - **imx.to**: Requires API key (get from imx.to account settings)
   - **pixhost.to**: Username and password (supports both v1 and v2 APIs)
   - **Other services**: Username and password

2. **Select Image Host** - Choose your preferred image hosting service from the dropdown

3. **Configure Settings** - Adjust thread limits, thumbnail sizes, and content ratings as needed

### Basic Upload Workflow

1. **Add Images:**
   - Click `File > Add Files` or `File > Add Folder`
   - Drag and drop files/folders directly into the window
   - Each folder becomes a separate upload batch/group

2. **Configure Batch:**
   - Edit the group title (double-click)
   - Select output template (BBCode, HTML, etc.)
   - Optionally select a ViperGirls thread for auto-posting

3. **Start Upload:**
   - Click `Start Upload`
   - Monitor real-time progress: speed (MB/s), percentage, and ETA
   - Uploads automatically retry on transient failures (3 attempts with exponential backoff: 1s→2s→4s)
   - View live progress updates every 2 seconds
   - Use `Retry Failed` button to manually retry any remaining failed uploads

4. **Get Results:**
   - Output files are saved to the `Output` folder
   - Backup copies saved to `~/.conniesuploader/history/`
   - If auto-copy is enabled, formatted text is copied to clipboard
   - Click `Open Output Folder` to view generated files

### Gallery Management

Access `Tools > Manage Galleries` to:
- View existing galleries
- Create new galleries
- Set gallery for current uploads

### Template Editor

Access `Tools > Template Editor` to:
- Create custom output templates
- Use placeholders: `{gallery_link}`, `{gallery_name}`, `{viewer}`, `{thumb}`, `{direct}`
- Preview templates with live data

### ViperGirls Integration

1. Set ViperGirls credentials in `Tools > Set Credentials > ViperGirls`
2. Access `Tools > Viper Tools` to:
   - Add thread URLs with custom names
   - Test credentials
3. When uploading, select a thread from the dropdown to auto-post results

**Security Note**: ViperGirls uses MD5 password hashing (legacy vBulletin API requirement). This is a documented limitation. Users should use unique passwords.

### Context Menu Integration (Windows)

Install `Tools > Install Context Menu` to add "Upload with Connie's Uploader" to Windows Explorer right-click menu.

### Graceful Shutdown

The application implements comprehensive graceful shutdown to ensure all resources are properly cleaned up:

**Shutdown Methods:**
- Click `File > Exit` in the menu
- Close the window (X button)
- Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal (if running from command line)
- Send `SIGTERM` signal (Unix-like systems)

**Shutdown Process:**
1. Stops any in-progress uploads (sets cancel event)
2. Terminates AutoPoster thread (with 3-second timeout)
3. Stops RenameWorker thread (with 2-second timeout)
4. Shuts down thumbnail executor
5. Cleans up upload manager and event listeners
6. Terminates Go sidecar process gracefully:
   - Closes stdin to signal shutdown
   - Waits up to 5 seconds for graceful exit
   - Forces termination if necessary
7. Closes log window if open
8. Exits application

**Benefits:**
- Prevents data corruption from abrupt termination
- Ensures all background threads complete cleanly
- Properly releases system resources (file handles, network connections)
- Logs shutdown progress for debugging

## Configuration

### Settings File
Application settings are stored in `user_settings.json` in the application directory.

### Credentials
Credentials are securely stored in the system keyring:
- **Windows**: Credential Manager
- **macOS**: Keychain
- **Linux**: Secret Service API

### Output Files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"uploader.exe not found" error:**
- Ensure the Go backend was built successfully: `go build -o uploader.exe uploader.go`
- The `uploader.exe` (or `uploader` on Linux/macOS) must be in the same directory as `main.py`
- Check sidecar logs in the execution log window

**Upload fails immediately:**
- Check credentials in `Tools > Set Credentials`
- Verify API key is correct for imx.to
- Check execution log: `View > Execution Log`
- Review error messages (now uses structured exceptions)

**Python dependencies error:**
- Ensure all requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try recreating the virtual environment
- Verify Python 3.11+ is installed

**Build errors:**
- **Go version**: Ensure Go 1.24+ is installed (`go version`)
- **Python version**: Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed (`python --version`)
- Check internet connection for dependency downloads
- Run `go mod download` to verify Go dependencies

**Sidecar crashes/restarts:**
- Sidecar auto-restarts up to 5 times with exponential backoff
- Check execution log for crash details
- Verify `uploader.exe` is not corrupted (rebuild if needed)

### Logs
- **Runtime logs**: `View > Execution Log` in the application
- **Crash logs**: `crash_log.log` in the application directory
- **Go backend logs**: Structured JSON format in execution log
- **Python logs**: Via loguru with configurable levels
